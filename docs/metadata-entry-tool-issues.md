# Metadata Entry Tool Follow-up Issues

1. Add validation layer ensuring mandatory fields are not empty before export.
2. Provide option to ingest existing device exports and pre-fill template.
3. Wire JSON-LD export to emit PROV activity skeletons for provenance_records.
4. Integrate CLI with webapp form for consistent UX and shared validation rules.
5. Add unit tests once a Node-based test harness is agreed upon.
